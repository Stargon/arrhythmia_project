# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to Use

The run the app, follow the instructions under the section [Action Scripts](#available-scripts).

Once the web page has loaded, the dashboard will be present with a dropdown menu containing all available data records that users can view. Select a patient number and click the submit button.

After a few seconds of loading, two graphs will appear containing the two distinct leads for the patient (names of graphs are hard coded to say MLII and V5, although actual data may be from different leads). These graphs display data in 1-minute intervals, and the whole 30 minutes can be traversed using the "Load Next" and "Load Previous" buttons located between the two graphs.

You can also jump to a specific time slice by using the two text fields above the charts, but will still only see data in 1-minute intervals.

The orange lines are annotations that are generated by Tyler Petty's machine learning model. The green data points are the actual annotations that were provided with the MIT arrhythmia data.

The "Current Patients" tab contains a small table with cursory information about each patient currently inside the database.

The "Upload new data" tab is where you can insert more patient records, with instructions on how to complete this on the page itself.

## Available Scripts


In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
